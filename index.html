            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>We are a group of like-minded women, working in tech or trying to start out working in tech in the city of
            Vienna. We motivate each other, post about speaking opportunities, give each other feedback and join events
            and hackathons together.</p>
            <p>If you are primarily identifying as a woman and are working, or interested in working in tech, feel free
            to join our merry little band.</p>
